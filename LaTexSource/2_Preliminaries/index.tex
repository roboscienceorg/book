\section{Preliminaries}\label{Chap:Preliminaries}}

In this chapter, we will discuss the collection of software tools used
in developing and deploying robots. Most of these tools are not robotics
specific such as Python or ZeroMQ. Others like ROS have been developed
just for robotics. We begin with an overview of the notation used and
some basic mathematical concepts. THen we give a brief survey of the
specific robotics tools. Next we will cover so basic concepts in
operating systems architecture and software design. The core tools we
will employ, ZeroMQ and SciPy are introduced.

Robotics as an academic subject can be very mathematical in nature. This
text does not attempt to place the subject on a rigorous mathematical
foundation, but it is necessary to use the mathematical formalism to
avoid confusion. So, we jump in with some common notation and then
proceed to the standard vocabulary that all robotics professionals use.
