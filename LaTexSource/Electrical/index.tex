\section{Electrical Concepts}\label{Chap:Electical}}

There are a wealth of useful sensors available to the robotics engineer.
These include force, pressure, temperature, light, radiation, and more.
If there is a form of energy that can be measured, then there is a
sensor to do the measuring. The vast majority of sensors in robotics are
electrically powered and operated. This section provides an overview of
the standard concepts found in Physics course. A course in sensors as
well as courses in mechatronics and instrumentation are the next steps
for the developing roboticist.
