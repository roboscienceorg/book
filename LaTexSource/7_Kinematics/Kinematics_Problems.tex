\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the following constraint holonomic:
  \(\dot{x}_2\sin(x_1) + x_2 \cos(x_1)\dot{x}_1 = 0\).
\item
  Is the differential drive motion model given by
  \texttt{ddkinematicsmodel} holonomic? Why or why not?
\item
  Show that the differential drive kinematic equations are non-holonomic
  constraints.
\item
  Derive \texttt{meccanumCFK}.
\item
  Assume that you have a square robot which is 50 cm per side and uses
  four 15 cm diameter omniwheels with\(\gamma=0\) configuration. The
  wheels are mounted at each corner at \(45^\circ\) to the sides. Find
  the kinematic equations of motion.
\item
  What are the motion equations for the Syncro Drive System as a
  function of wheel velocity and wheel turn angle? Use \(r\) for wheel
  radius.
\item
  Derive the equations of motion for the three wheel omniwheel robot,
  \texttt{Fig:Tribot}.
