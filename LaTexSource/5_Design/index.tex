\section{Robotics Design Elements}\label{Chap:Design}}

Before we proceed with building robots, we need to address several
aspects of robot design which includes human aspects such as safety,
human interaction and human environments. Robots can be very helpful,
capable even lifesaving devices. However they can pose serious risks
which need to be recognized and addressed. In addition, there are
complexities in working with humans and in human environments which need
to be addressed as well. In this short chapter we examine some of the
issues.
