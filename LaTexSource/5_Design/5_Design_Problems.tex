\item
  What are the pros and cons to sharing address space?
\item
  How does a system call differ from a function call?
\item
  How can a message passing system be used to coordinate two processes?
  Show a pseudo-code example.
\item
  What are some pros and cons with centralized server architectures for
  coordinating multiprocess communication?
\item
  Many industrial systems have fences or cages that contain the robot
  which prevents human-robot collisions. The cage system is designed to
  shut power if the cage door is open. Some of these systems have a key
  and lock that prevents restarting. This has been defeated by a worker
  closing the cage door after entry, not taking the key and another
  worker by accident powering up the robot. Describe some additions to
  this system which could prevent this breach of safe operation.
\item
  Name two very simple things that can be done to make industrial robots
  safer.
\item
  List some periods of robot operation that are very risky for humans.
  What can be done to mitigate the risk?
\item
  What needs to be addressed for humans to comfortably work with robots?
\item
  What is the cause of uncanny valley?
\item
  Provide an example not in the text of an exploit of a robotics system.
