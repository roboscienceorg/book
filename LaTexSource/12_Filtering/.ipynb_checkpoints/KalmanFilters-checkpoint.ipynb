    "# The Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we develop the multivariate version of the Kalman\n",
    "Filter. The steps are basically the same as the scalar version described\n",
    "in the last section, but the derivation is more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Multivariate Version\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Kalman Filter` has two stages. A predictive step based on the\n",
    "system dynamics and an update based on observations or measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full Kalman Filter has the following objects to track:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *Prediction*: $\\hat{x}_{k|k-1}$, $P_{k|k-1}$\n",
    "-   *Update*: $\\hat{x}_{k|k}$, $P_{k|k}$\n",
    "-   $P_{k|k} =  \\textrm{cov}(x_k -  \\hat{x}_{k|k})$\n",
    "-   $P_{k|k-1} = \\textrm{cov}(x_k - \\hat{x}_{k|k-1})$\n",
    "-   $S_{k} = \\textrm{cov}(z_k - H\\hat{x}_{k|k-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction step uses the system dynamics, the linear dynamical\n",
    "model, to predict where the system should be. This prediction is for\n",
    "both the state estimate $\\hat{x}$ and the covariance of $\\hat{x}$. This\n",
    "stage is also known as the *a priori* since it occurs before the\n",
    "observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update step takes the observation at that step and compares it to\n",
    "the prediction. The difference between the two is known as the\n",
    "innovation. It is what is new compared to the system dynamics. Using a\n",
    "weighted least squares approach, the two are merged. This is done by\n",
    "determining how reliable the new information is based on the innovation\n",
    "covariance. The weight term is known as the Kalman gain. The weighted\n",
    "innovation is added to the prediction of the state estimate to obtain\n",
    "the Kalman estimate. As before, this stage is also known as the *a\n",
    "posteriori* because it occurs after the observation. Repeated steps or\n",
    "iterations of the Kalman filter allow the filter to track sequential\n",
    "stages of a process. These sequential steps make this a recursive linear\n",
    "gaussian state estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally we have a dynamical process\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{k+1} = F_k x_k + Gu_k + v_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_k$ is the state transition matrix, $Gu_k$ is the input control\n",
    "and and observation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_k = Hx_k + w_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H$ is the observation matrix. The random variables $v_k$, $w_k$\n",
    "are drawn from Gaussian distributions with covariance models given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = E[v_kv_k^T], \\quad\\quad W = E[w_kw_k^T].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The error covariance of the estimate is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_k = E[e_ke_k^T] = E[(x_k - \\hat{x}_k)(x_k - \\hat{x}_k)^T] .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The state estimate will be denoted $\\hat{x}_k$ and the process update to\n",
    "the state is denoted $\\tilde{x}_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into the details on the filter design, a couple of comments\n",

    "> The matrix $F$ is given by the model of the physical process. It is a\n",
    "> square matrix with dimension $n \\times n$ where $n$ is the number of\n",

    "> dynamical system, make sure you first discretize the problem. Only\n",
    "> then can you extract the correct matrix $F$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The matrix $G$ is more of a placeholder for now. We assume that we\n",
    "> have some type of control input $Gu_k$ but for our discussion you\n",
    "> don't need to write this in any special form as long as you add the\n",
    "> control values into the process update. Meaning you don't need to\n",
    "> figure out matrix $G$ to do the process update step.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The matrix $H$ is the observation matrix. This acts to relate the\n",
    "> observed variables to the state variables. For example, say that you\n",
    "> have a state vector of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and can observe all three as\n",
    "> $z = (z_{x_1}, z_{x_2}, z_{x_3})$. Then\n",

    "\n",
    "## Some issues to address\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Kalman filter is trying to estimate the state, and determine\n",
    "the process as well as the observation quality, the initial iterations\n",
    "may be very inaccurate. Assuming you have a convergent process, it can\n",
    "still take some time for the filter to converge and provide a good state\n",
    "estimate. What the filter is doing is figuring out the errors for the\n",
    "state estimate (the covariance $P$). Many robotics applications will\n",
    "have the robot sit still for a few seconds to allow the filter to\n",
    "converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question is what should the initial values be? For the state\n",
    "estimate, one clearly uses starting information that one has. The\n",
    "problem is that maybe not all the data is known. For unknown variables,\n",
    "setting to zero is about all you can do. The corresponding entry in the\n",
    "covariance matrix should be infinity (or a very large value). Another\n",
    "approach for the covariance is to set it to zero and let the first dozen\n",
    "iterations figure out the covariance or one can populate it with values.\n",
    "One could even store the covariance after the filter settles and use\n",
    "that to initialize the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix $W$, we use the sensor datasheets which can provide standard\n",
    "deviations for sensor readings. The squares of those can be placed on\n",
    "the diagonal of $W$. The matrix $V$ is harder to determine and may\n",
    "require some experimentation. A simplistic approach would be to run the\n",
    "robot for a single step and measure the end state. Repeat this process\n",
    "for a large enough times as possible. That endstate measurement data can\n",
    "be used to determine the variances of the process as well as can be used\n",
    "to adjust the process in case of parameter issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation on this approach for $V$ is to run the robot in for multiple\n",
    "time steps and do the statistics on the end state as before. Another\n",
    "method is to compare the Kalman estimation with the actual state (done\n",
    "by hand measurement and not onboard sensing). The tune the parameters.\n",
    "You can then optimize to gain good choices for $V$, $W$. It should be\n",
    "noted that $V$ is the estimate for a given $\\Delta t$. It needs to be\n",
    "scaled for time steps other than the one it was developed for. So, if\n",
    "$V$ was developed for a time step of $\\Delta t$ and the Kalman\n",
    "estimation loops are using a time step of $T$ , then\n",
    "$V' = (T/ \\Delta t) V$ would scale the covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One concern follows from unreliable sensor connections. What happens\n",
    "when a sensor is down or is not sending data? The Kalman gain is the\n",
    "term that selects the relative amount of the model verses the sensor to\n",
    "use in the estimate. Lacking a sensor, the Kalman gain will after some\n",
    "iterations shut off that sensor. It will do this even if the sensor is\n",
    "operational if the sensor is giving readings that don’t make sense given\n",
    "the physical model, so the Kalman gain will move to where only the\n",
    "physical model is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_k = P_kH_k^TS_k^{-1} \\to 0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter does not correct for drift that occurs in gyros and\n",
    "other instruments. The common fix is to periodically reset (zero) the\n",
    "sensor when in a known configuration - for example when the vehicle is\n",
    "stopped and you know it is not turning. The issue of course is that\n",
    "after a period of time the Kalman estimate becomes just the process\n",
