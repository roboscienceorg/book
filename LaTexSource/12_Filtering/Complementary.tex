\subsection{Complementary Filter}\label{complementary-filter}}

Assume that you have two different sensors (measurements from two
different sources) in which one sensor has high frequency noise and the
other sensor has low frequency noise. A complementary filter exploits
this situation by applying a low pass filter to the first sensor data
and a high pass filter to the second sensor. The two signals
``complement'' each other in terms of information.
