Motion Control
**************

One of the core properties of a robot is the ability to move. In this
chapter we discuss moving the robot in a predetermined or controlled
manner. Given a particular path or type of motion, we address how to
perform it. This falls under a large engineering discipline known as
controls and we will just touch on a few concepts here. The main example
we will use is the differential drive robot. It is a significant robot
in its own right, and presents many of the challenges found in most
mobile robotic systems.
