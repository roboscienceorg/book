Manipulators: Arms and Legs
===========================

.. Note:: Write this chapter.  Currently these are converted slides.


There is a wealth of literature on robotic manipulators especially in
the context of fixed industrial robots.  This is an important area of
study but will not be duplicated here.  This text is focused on mobile
systems.  Manipulators enter as arms and legs.  It is possible to mount
a robotic manipulator on the robot chassis.  The group of manipulators
which are only involved in transporting the robot we will call legs,
and the rest will be called arms.  The control of these might not
be at all different and strictly rely on use.

In the first section we lay down some basic terms required for the
methods presented on forward kinematics derivation.   The actual forward
and inverse kinematics will be treated in the following section on
Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters.
