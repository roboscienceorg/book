Problems

#. Assume you have a laser triangulation system as shown in
   :numref:`fig:lasertriangulation2` given
   by :eq:`industrialvision` and
   that :math:`f  = 8`\ mm, :math:`b = 30`\ cm. What are the ranges for
   :math:`\alpha` and :math:`u` if we need to measure target distances in a
   region (in cm) :math:`20 < z < 100` and :math:`10 < x < 30`?


#. Assume you have two cameras that are calibrated into a stereo pair with
   a baseline of 10cm, and focal depth of 7mm. If the error is 10% on
   :math:`v_1` and :math:`v_2`, :math:`v_1 =  2`\ mm and
   :math:`v_2 = 3`\ mm, what is the error on the depth measurement
   :math:`z`? Your answer should be a percentage relative to the error free
   number. Hint: If :math:`v_1 = 2` then a 10% error ranges from 1.8 to
   2.2. [Although not required, another way to approach this problem is the
   total differential from calculus.]


#. Assume you have two cameras that are calibrated into a stereo pair with
   an estimated baseline of 10cm, and focal depth of 10mm. If the error is
   10% on the baseline, what is error on the depth measurement :math:`z`
   with :math:`v_1 = 2`\ mm and :math:`v_2 = 3`\ mm? Your answer should be
   a percentage relative to the error free number. See the hint above.


#. With a single camera, explain how a straight line (produced by a laser)
   can resolve depth information.
