Problems
--------

#. Let :math:`z_1 = 284`, :math:`z_2 = 257`, :math:`z_3 = 295`, be
   measurements from sensors which have normally distributed errors with
   standard deviations :math:`\sigma_1 = 10`, :math:`\sigma_2 = 20`,
   :math:`\sigma_3 = 15`, respectively. What is the best estimate for the
   measured state?

#. You are given three distance sensors which all measure the same
   distance. To determine the accuracy of each you run repeated
   measurements of an object which you setup so that the sensor will return
   2 meters. Running 40 measurements you obtain the data listed below.
   Next you measure the distance
   of an object ahead of the robot. Sensor A gives 2.4577696, sensor B gives
   1.8967743, and sensor C gives 2.1352561. Combine these readings to make a
   more accurate estimate of the object distance. Hint: you need to figure
   out the distributions and the data according to the variances.

#. Perform a numerical study on the three sensor problem. The claim is that
   if you fuse the three sensor measurements using the formula derived in
   the text, the fused value (the estimate) is a better estimate than that
   any of the measurement values even if one measurement comes from a
   sensor with a very low error (small standard deviation). Generate sample
   values from three distributions with the same mean (select mean = 5) but
   very different sigmas (sigma1 = 0.05, sigma2 = 0.25, sigma3 = 0.5). Run
   1000 experiments and compute the percentage for which this is true.

#. Let :math:`x = (x_1,x_2)`, :math:`y=(y_1,y_2)` and define
   :math:`d(x,y) = \| x - y\|_P` where :math:`\| x \|_P^2 =\, x^TPx` for

   .. math::

      P = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 3 & 0.1 \\ 0.1 & 1
      \end{array}\right).

   Find the closest point on the line :math:`x_2 = 10 - 5x_1` to the origin
   with respect to :math:`d(x,y)`.

#. Model determination

   #. Assume that you run an experiment on a single step. Starting from
      :math:`(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (1, 1, 0.5)`, you obtain x, y, w:

      This data is repeated experiments and NOT iteration data. The means
      that each row is generated by starting from the initial condition and
      taking on step of your machine. Determine the parameters, a, b, c,
      and covariance V for the kinematic model with zero mean Gaussian
      noise based on dynamics:

      .. math:: x_k = x_{k-1} + (x_{k-1}^2 + y_{k-1}^2)\cos(w_{k-1}) +a,

      .. math:: y_k = y_{k-1} + (x_{k-1}^2 + y_{k-1}^2)\sin(w_{k-1})+b ,

      .. math:: w_k = w_{k-1} + (x_{k-1}^2 + y_{k-1}^2 + w_{k-1}^2)^{1/2}+c.

      Approach this by computing the mean of each column. Using the means
      you can estimate a,b,c. Then using the covariance estimation given in
      the notes, you can find the covariance matrix.

   #. Assume that you have zero mean Gaussian data. Find a standard
      deviation that produces data where you observe that 20% of the time
      you have three correct digits (meaning three zeros). This is not
      unique. Can you also find a sigma that gives you the previous
      observation but also 80% of the time you see two correct (or zero)
      digits. Can you write an observational model for this?
