Terms and Basic Concepts of Robotics
************************************

Getting the language down is the first step. Robotics is like any other
engineering field with lots of jargon and specialized terms. The terms
do convey important concepts which we will introduce here.

There are three examples which we will examine: the serial two
link arm, the parallel two link arm and the differential drive mobile
robot. The serial two link manipulator is a simple robot arm that has
two straight links each driven by an actuator (like a servo). They serve
as basic examples of common robotic systems and are used to introduce
some basic concepts. The parallel two link arm is a two dimensional
version of a common 3D Printer known as the Delta configuration. Last is
the differential drive mobile robot. This design has two drive wheels
and then a drag castor wheel. The two drive wheels can operate
independently like a skid steer “Bobcat”.
