Problems

#. What are the pros and cons to sharing address space?

#. How does a system call differ from a function call?

#. How can a message passing system be used to coordinate two processes?
   Show a pseudo-code example.

#. What are some pros and cons with centralized server architectures for
   coordinating multiprocess communication?

#. Many industrial systems have fences or cages that contain the robot
   which prevents human-robot collisions. The cage system is designed to
   shut power if the cage door is open. Some of these systems have a key
   and lock that prevents restarting. This has been defeated by a worker
   closing the cage door after entry, not taking the key and another worker
   by accident powering up the robot. Describe some additions to this
   system which could prevent this breach of safe operation.

#. Name two very simple things that can be done to make industrial robots
   safer.

#. List some periods of robot operation that are very risky for humans.
   What can be done to mitigate the risk?

#. What needs to be addressed for humans to comfortably work with robots?

#. What is the cause of uncanny valley?

#. Provide an example not in the text of an exploit of a robotics system.
