Particle Filters
----------------

.. Note:: Lots to add for this section.

Particle filters are a form of sequential Monte Carlo methods used to
address the hidden Markov chain and nonlinear filtering problems.
Normally known as a non-parametric filter and separated from Kalman
Filters, we will treat them together as forms of dynamic state
estimation. It is essentially a form of a genetic algorithm applied to
state estimation and is a popular form of non-parametric alternative to
the Gaussian filters (Kalman Filter). Particle filters use a finite
number of discrete variables to approximate the posterior. The basic
algorithm for one step of the filter is given
AlgorithmÂ `alg:particlefilter`_. We will use
the notation that :math:`x_k` is a particle, :math:`X_k` is the set of
paticles, :math:`u_k` is the control input and :math:`z_k` is the
observation at time step :math:`k`.

.. topic::  Particle Filter. :cite:`thrun2005probabilistic`

   | **Input** :math:`X_{k-1}`, :math:`u_k`, :math:`z_k`
   | **Output** :math:`X_k`
   | Initialize :math:`Y`, :math:`X_k` to zero.
   | **for** :math:`m=1` to :math:`M` **do**
   |   Sample :math:`x_k^m` from :math:`p(x_k | u_k, x_{k-1}^m)`
   |   :math:`w_k^m = p(z_k|x_k^m)`
   |   :math:`Y = Y + [x_k^m]`
   | **end for**
   | **for** :math:`m=1` to :math:`M` **do**
   |   Select :math:`x_k^i` from :math:`Y` with probability :math:`w^i_k`
   |   :math:`X_k = X_k + [x_k^i]`
   | **endfor**

The standard algorithm for resampling selects the particle based on some
probability which is proportional to the probability of the observation
given the particle, often called the weight of the particle,
:math:`w_k`. One approach to this is in algorithm
`alg:probsample`_. In the Evolutionary Computation
literature this is a form of Roulette selection. A low variance resample
approach which numerically faster can be found in algorithm
`alg:lowvariancesample`_. To obtain good
state estimates, it may be necessary to use many particles which can
require significant computation. This is the tradeoff when compared to
Gaussian filters (Kalman Filter).


.. _`alg:probsample`:
.. topic::  Resample algorithm.  Uses the particle weights to set the sampling probability.

   | **Input** :math:`Y` (particle set), :math:`w^i`, :math:`w = \sum w^i`
   | **Output** :math:`X` (resampled particle set)
   | Initialize :math:`X` to zero
   | **for** :math:`m=1` to :math:`M` **do**
   |   Generate :math:`r`, random number from uniform distribution :math:`(0,w)`
   |   :math:`s = 0`, :math:`i = 0`
   |   **while** :math:`s < r` **do**
   |     :math:`s = s + w^i`
   |     :math:`i = i+1`
   |   **end while**
   |   :math:`X = X + \{x_i\}`
   | **end for**

   The Particle Filter applied to the motion of a differential drive
   robot using the same dynamics as EKF example above. The simulation
   pose is given by the blue line, the observation of the pose given by
   the red dots and the pose estimate is given by the black line. 50
   particles are used and the average is the pose estimate.

The example particle filter above
`alg:particlefilter`_ uses a fixed population
size. Since particle filters are closely related to evolutionary
algorithms, we can adapt them to state estimation. The particle filter
here has two stages:

1. Dynamics Update
    Sample from the particle set to produce a temporary particle set.
    This advances the dynamics like the first step in the Kalman Filter.
    In the first stage, one can produce any number of sample particles.

2. Observation Update
    Resample based on the measurement to produce final particle set.
    This stage, the observation is used to select particles. The
    particles are selected based on the probability of the observation
    based on the particle. This stage can reduce the number of particles
    if needed. For example, this step can downsample to keep a fixed
    population size.

   The second Particle Filter applied to the motion of a differential
   drive robot as above. This filter double samples the physics, sorts
   the candidate particles and enforces a rank selection to reduce to
   required population size. The simulation pose is given by the blue
   line, the observation of the pose given by the red dots and the pose
   estimate is given by the black line. 50 particles are used and the
   average is the pose estimate.
