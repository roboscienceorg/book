SciPy and Mathematics
---------------------

The following material assumes that you are familiar with Python. Python
reads like pseudocode and so it is possible to follow along without a
background in Python if you have seen some other programming language. A
quick introduction is given in the Appendices for those who want to ramp
up before reading on.


SciPy, is a collection of open-source packages for Scientific
Computing. One of the packages, redundantly named, SciPy library is a
collection of numerical methods including special functions,
integration, optimization, linear algebra, interpolation, and other
standard mathematics routines. NumPy is an open-source Python package
supporting data structures and low level algorithms for scientific
computing which is used by SciPy. [#f1]_ The main data structure of
interest to us from numpy is an array type and efficient methods to
access array elements.

Many of the implementations of iPython load NumPy and SciPy (as well as
the plotting package matlibplot) automatically. The idea is that most
users of iPython are going to use these. To use the NumPy or SciPy
libraries you need to import them. Since the scientific libraries are
large, we don’t want to drop them into the main namespace. The Python
community often uses the following names for the namespaces:

::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import scipy as sp
    >>> import matplotlib as mpl
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Scipy sub-packages need to be imported separately, for example:

::

    >>> from scipy import linalg, optimize

As stated above, some versions of iPython (some IDEs) will import
certain libraries for you. Say you are tired of typing the five import
lines above each time you run iPython. There is a full configuration
system available. To find the location of the config files, type at the
command prompt

.. code:: bash

    $ ipython locate
    /home/yourloginname/.ipython

    $ ipython locate profile foo
    /home/yourloginname/.ipython/profile_foo

You may create a profile for each of the different iPython activities.
We will stick with the default which is profile_default. The startup
files, files that get run when you start iPython, are located in the
startup subdirectory. In my case this is:

| /Users/jmcgough/.ipython/profile_default/startup

Inside the startup directory, I created a file: 05-early.py containing

::

    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp
    import matplotlib as mpl
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

which then runs those import commands each time iPython is invoked. In
this next section, we will review some needed mathematics and introduce
SciPy as we proceed.



Vectors and Matrices
--------------------

Creation of an array is easy:

::

    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: x = np.array([2,3,6,4,5,0])

    In [3]: x
    Out[3]: array([2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 0])

    In [4]: len(x)
    Out[4]: 6

The array command takes a list and converts it to an array object.
Arrays are stored like C does it, in row major order. To create an array
of numbers from 0 to 10:

::

    In [2]: x = np.arange(10)

    In [3]: x
    Out[3]: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    In [4]: 2*x+1
    Out[4]: array([ 1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19])

    In [5]: x*x
    Out[5]: array([ 0,  1,  4,  9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81])

    In [6]: np.sqrt(x)
    Out[6]:
    array([ 0.        ,  1.        ,  1.41421356,  1.73205081,  2.        ,
            2.23606798,  2.44948974,  2.64575131,  2.82842712,  3.        ])

    In [7]: np.sin(0.2*x)
    Out[7]:
    array([ 0.        ,  0.19866933,  0.38941834,  0.56464247,  0.71735609,
            0.84147098,  0.93203909,  0.98544973,  0.9995736 ,  0.97384763])

    In [8]: np.sin(0.2*x)[3]
    Out[8]: 0.56464247339503548

    In [9]: x < 7
    Out[9]: array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True,
                      True,  True, False, False, False], dtype=bool)

    In [10]: x.sum()
    Out[10]: 45

    In [11]: x.max()
    Out[11]: 9

    In [12]: x.min()
    Out[12]: 0

    In [13]: x.mean()
    Out[13]: 4.5

    In [14]: x.std()
    Out[14]: 2.8722813232690143

    In [15]: np.where(x < 7)
    Out[15]: (array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]),)

Note that indexing works like normal Python lists. A few vector
operations are also available as methods.

::

    In [2]: x = np.arange(10)

    In [3]: y = np.ones(10)

    In [4]: x
    Out[4]: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    In [5]: y
    Out[5]: array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])

    In [6]: np.dot(x,y)
    Out[6]: 45.0

    In [7]: np.outer(x,y)
    Out[7]:
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.],
           [ 4.,  4.,  4.,  4.,  4.,  4.,  4.,  4.,  4.,  4.],
           [ 5.,  5.,  5.,  5.,  5.,  5.,  5.,  5.,  5.,  5.],
           [ 6.,  6.,  6.,  6.,  6.,  6.,  6.,  6.,  6.,  6.],
           [ 7.,  7.,  7.,  7.,  7.,  7.,  7.,  7.,  7.,  7.],
           [ 8.,  8.,  8.,  8.,  8.,  8.,  8.,  8.,  8.,  8.],
           [ 9.,  9.,  9.,  9.,  9.,  9.,  9.,  9.,  9.,  9.]])

Some NumPy examples using 2D arrays (or matrices):

::

    In [2]: A = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])

    In [3]: print A
    [[1 2 3]
     [4 5 6]]

    In [4]: B = np.array([[9,8],[7,6],[5,4]])

    In [5]: print B
    [[9 8]
     [7 6]
     [5 4]]

    In [6]: A*B
    --------------------------
    ValueError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-6-e2f71f566704> in <module>()
    ----> 1 A*B

    ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes
    (2,3) (3,2)

    In [7]: np.dot(A,B)
    Out[7]:
    array([[ 38,  32],
           [101,  86]])

    In [8]: A.T
    Out[8]:
    array([[1, 4],
           [2, 5],
           [3, 6]])

    In [9]: A.T + B
    Out[9]:
    array([[10, 12],
           [ 9, 11],
           [ 8, 10]])

Note: Most of the python overloaded math operators are defined
elementwise. As such :math:`*` does not make sense for :math:`A*B` since
the arrays are not the same dimension. The point is that you need to be
careful and in this case you need to call the correct function to do
matrix multiplication and not array multiplication.

One can easily create a two dimensional array by reshaping:

::

    In [10]: z = np.arange(16)

    In [11]: z
    Out[11]: array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12,
                                    13, 14, 15])

    In [12]: z.shape = (4,4)

    In [13]: z
    Out[13]:
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    In [14]: z[1,3]
    Out[14]: 7

    In [15]: z[1,-4]
    Out[15]: 4

Using previous examples of :math:`A` and :math:`B`:

::

    In [16]: import numpy.linalg as npl

    In [17]: npl.det(np.dot(A,B))
    Out[17]: 35.99999999999968




Linear Algebra
--------------

We use both NumPy and SciPy for Linear Algebra problems. NumPy is used
to provide the array data structure and the numerical methods are
provided in SciPy.

::

    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: import scipy as sp

    In [3]: from scipy import linalg as spl

    In [4]: A = np.array([[3,1,0],[1,5,1],[0,2,6]])

    In [5]: A
    Out[5]:
    array([[3, 1, 0],
           [1, 5, 1],
           [0, 2, 6]])

    In [6]: b = np.array([[3,2,1]]).T

    In [7]: b
    Out[7]:
    array([[3],
           [2],
           [1]])

    In [8]: x1 = spl.inv(A).dot(b)  # x = inverse(A)*b

    In [9]: x1
    Out[9]:
    array([[ 0.93589744],
           [ 0.19230769],
           [ 0.1025641 ]])

    In [10]: x2 = spl.solve(A,b)  # solve Ax = b

    In [11]: x2
    Out[11]:
    array([[ 0.93589744],
           [ 0.19230769],
           [ 0.1025641 ]])

    In [12]: A.dot(x1)
    Out[12]:
    array([[ 3.],
           [ 2.],
           [ 1.]])

One question that arises is regarding performance. There is a
significant difference between plain Python and NumPy. This author’s
experiments have shown that NumPy performs very well and has fallen
within 10-20% of plain C in some cases. Given how powerful the
Python-NumPy combination is, this is a small price.

::

    In [2]: import scipy.linalg as lin

    In [3]: a = np.array([[3, 1, 0], [1, 5, 1],  [0, 2, 6]])

    In [4]: lin.eig(a)
    Out[4]:
    (array([ 2.48586307+0.j,  4.42800673+0.j,  7.08613020+0.j]),
     array([[ 0.86067643,  0.39715065,  0.11600488],
           [-0.44250554,  0.5671338 ,  0.47401104],
           [ 0.25184308, -0.72154737,  0.87284386]]))

Eigenvalues pop up all through engineering computations and we will use
the built in SciPy routines to compute them. The most common application
later will be finding the error ellipses for variance-covariance
matrices in the Kalman Filter.

Least Squares Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Assume that you have the raw data ready in arrays :math:`x` and
  :math:`y`. Then
  :numref:`Fig:weightedLSdata` and
  :numref:`Fig:weightedLSplot` can be produced by:

::

    one = np.ones((N))
    A = np.array([ x, one]).T
    AT = A.T
    AA = np.dot(AT,A)
    ATy = np.dot(AT,y)
    t = np.arange(0,10, 0.2)
    B = np.array([t,np.ones(len(t))]).T

    c = linalg.solve(AA,ATy)
    line1 = np.dot(B,c)

    weights =[]
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        v = 1.0/(i*i*i)
        sum = sum + v
        weights.append(v)

    for i in range(N):
        weights[i] = weights[i]/sum

    ww = np.diagflat(weights)
    A1 = np.dot(ww,A)
    AA = np.dot(AT,A1)
    y1 = np.dot(ww,y)
    ATy = np.dot(AT,y1)
    coeff2 = linalg.solve(AA,ATy)
    line2 = np.dot(B,coeff2)

    # Plot result: red is data, blue is uniformly weighted,
    #  green is weighted to points near the origin.
    plt.plot(t,line1, 'b-', t,line2, 'g-', x,y, 'r.')
    plt.show()
