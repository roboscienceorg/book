In this chapter, we model several motion systems and focus one of the
most common robot drive systems known as the differential drive. We
begin with ground contact components such as wheels and tracks. Move to
steering and drive systems. The differential drive will work as the
canonical example for which other drive systems will be discussed.
Following the differential drive we derive a general approve to modeling
drive systems. This is used to model steered vehicles and several types
of Omniwheel systems.
