=======================

This course began in 2009 as mixed senior undergraduate
and first year graduate student offering.   Very quickly it became clear
that most of the challenge was in the breadth of material and skill set of
the students.  Since then I have proceeded to make every mistake possible
with this class.   Fortunately at a small school we have forgiving students.
This book, specifically the content and organization, is a result of the
decade of running the class and correcting those errors.

The goal of this text is several fold.   First, there are limited offerings
in this space.   You can find K-12 materials on robots, especially with
the Lego system, easily on the internet.  There is a ton of hobbyist
sites (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc) that are fabulous.  The problem is that they
lack the completeness
and rigor needed for a college course.  Since robotics is a research
area, finding graduate level references is not hard, but we have the
opposite problem of that being too difficult or not sufficiently
general in scope.   [And honestly, even
some undergraduate texts outside your personal area of expertise
can feel like a graduate text.]

The second goal was to create a text aimed at students with more of a
computer science background and not Mechanical/Electrical Engineering
background as with most of the college level texts available.  In addition,
we are working to expose these students to a diverse curriculum since it
is just not reasonable to get three or four Bachelor degrees to be a
well schooled roboticist.

So, this text attempts to survey the field, provide sufficient depth for
the student and
cover current industry tools, all while keeping the course engaging to students.
We have worked to balance theory with practice since it seems to help
the learning and retention process.  There is some mixing of
topics to keep student interest.  Earlier versions of the course were
partitioned over fields and application.   Students liked having material
mixed and then progressing in level.    So, because of this, the ordering
of chapters might not be as expected.  We have worked hard to get the student
up and running in virtual as well as real robots as soon as practical.  Some
theoretical (important) material is left to later in the text.  One benefit
is that when students try the simple approaches, and those fail, they more
easily understand the more advanced and mathematical approaches later.

It is easier to limit or focus the students
in the class.  However, a diversity of students makes for a better course.
The problem then is that you cannot assume all students have the same background.
In the version we offer at SDSMT, we have Data Structures and Differential Equations as background.
However, we want students from Mechanical and Electrical Engineering to
participate and at SDSMT they normally don't take Data Structures.  Likewise,
many Computer Science students will not have Differential Equations in their
background.   We normally meet and make sure they understand what elements
that they might need to make up.   Then sign them in.  This works well for us.

We run a one semester course.   There is more material here than a three or
four credit semester course (15 week) can address.  Now that the text has been
open sourced and placed online, we expect the text to grow.  There are a couple
of directions we can proceed.  One is to fork the text repo and build multiple
textbooks for different applications (such as student levels or backgrounds,
or goals).  Another is having a modular system which the instructor selects
sections/chapters and have Sphinx build a custom text.  If you have thoughts
on this or would like a custom text built now, please contact Jeff McGough,
