Student Notes
=============

These notes are intended for both formal students and casual readers.  In
2009, SDSMT Computer Science offered a Mobile Robotics course for the first time.
As mentioned above, we used *Introduction to Autonomous Mobile
Robots* by Siegwart and  Nourbakhsh :cite:`Siegwart:2004:IAM` .
This book has evolved from course notes.  There is a significant lack
of textbooks on robotics for those individuals who approach the subject with
a computing background and interest.   This is not suprising since the
bulk of the effort in robotics over the last 50 years has been with the
design and control of the mechanical and electrical systems.

It is only recently that the embedded computing and the supporting
software has been powerful enough to attempt to deal with the complexity
found in unstructured environments outside manufacturing.  The landscape is
changing and with the advent of self-driving cars and other autonomous
systems, the need for computer scientists in robotics is accelerating.
This book attempts to balance the competing forces of presenting a
complete thorough coverage with the normal constraints on time and
resources.  Robotics covers many different disciplines.  Some specific
techniques can require a great deal of mathematics or other specialized
skill.  Our goal is to get you up and running as quickly as possible
without sacrificing the core concepts needed to progress later.  We will
iterate through the subject preceeding deeper on each pass.

With this approach we can get you running with a robotic system without months
of theory.  But we will come back and build on what you have learned.
A bit like an Agile method applied to your learning.   In past versions
of the course, we have separated material.  So, we would do all of the
mechanical content, then all of the electrical content, then algorithms, tools
and so forth.  This approach was well criticized on Medium.com with a
burrito analogy.   Imagine having the burrito with all of the beans on
one end, then a section of only meat, a section of cheese and the other end
was the sauce and seasoning.  Not very appealing.  Our goal is, when it
makes sense, to "mix it up".  Not only does this avoid boredom, it should
help with understanding how to integrate the concepts.

We have developed the chapters to be as independent as possible.  So, one
could read the chapters out of order.  However, we have a progression
that has developed over a decade presenting the concepts and we think
this will be the most effective for those who want a more complete
understanding of the subject.  In addition, there is an
iterative approach to trying to get you up and running quickly, so jumping
around may extend the learning time.  So, we suggest that you consider reading
the chapters in the order presented.

A common question is "what background is really needed?"  We will be using
algorithms and software to solve problems.  So, you need to know how to program.
Language is not important since once you know one language it is very
easy to learn another.  This book uses Python to demonstrate concepts.
Python is really easy to learn and use.  For our purposes it is plenty
fast enough and is the choice for robotics prototyping.   The algorithms
will employ certain data structures which if you don't have a course in
data structures can be understood after a good second programming course.

There are times when we need to model the robot's electrical or mechanical
systems.  These models are based in calculus and physics.  You should
have a year of calculus and a year of physics.  Ideally you would have seen
a course in probability and a course in linear algebra.  This is not the case
for everyone and so we have the essential math covered in the appendix.
