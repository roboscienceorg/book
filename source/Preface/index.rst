Preface

Historically, the academic study of robotics has been limited to the
Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering departments. This makes
perfect sense if the target field is manufacturing. Often requiring
significant power, reliable repetition or precise positioning, these
departments focused on machine design, controls and targeted
instrumentation. Leaving the factory floor, however, requires a great
deal more in generalized sensing and machine ability. It demands
powerful computing and far more advanced algorithms. To address this
need, the Computer Science department at the South Dakota School of
Mines and Technology decided to include Robotics as part of the Computer
Science curriculum. We developed a course devoted to robotics. The
original course began with the text *Introduction to Autonomous Mobile
Robots* by Siegwart and  Nourbakhsh :cite:`Siegwart:2004:IAM` .
It is a really good survey text.  The issue that arose was that we
found ourselves having to fill in details, add
content, provide more current examples, provide information on
frameworks and enhance focus on software. The slides, notes and handouts
ended up growing into this text.

The word “robotics” encompasses many different meanings and fields. This
is very different from a subject like Calculus, for example, for which
all the books written in the last two centuries cover the exact same
material - nearly lining up in chapter and section numbers. Not so with
robotics. This subject touches on all of the engineering disciplines,
mathematics, computer science (if this was not on your engineering list)
and several of the sciences. It can be aimed at children, hobbyists,
engineers, researchers, managers, evil scientists and many more. Finding
a textbook that fell at the right level and contained the specific
subjects that we wanted turned out to be a difficult task. There are
many, many very great books on the subject, but none that addressed the
needs of juniors and seniors studying computer science.

This text exists to present the particular subjects we wanted to cover
and relate them at the level that is appropriate for our students. Our
course is aimed at computer science students who have had three
semesters of Calculus, a semester of differential equations, a semester
of linear algebra, exposure to computer hardware, and significant
experience with software development. This book will take a computer
science perspective and a software focus. The ordering of the material
is based on the typical interests and goals for someone who is a senior
in computer science wanting to learn about controlling mechatronic
systems.
