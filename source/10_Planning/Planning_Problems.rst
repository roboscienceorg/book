Problems
--------

#. Let the domain be the rectangle :math:`0\leq x \leq 15` and
   :math:`0 \leq y \leq 10`. Place the start position at (0,5). Place the
   end position at (15,5). Assume you have a disk centered at (6,4) with
   radius 2 and a disk centered at (8,6) with radius 3. Find a potential
   function which can navigate the robot from the start to the end
   position.

   #. Plot the resulting path in Python with obstacles included in the map.

   #. Compare to the Wavefront approach.

#. Rework the previous problem with a Poisson navigation function.

#. Write a Python program to implement the Brushfire algorithm and extract
   the equidistance pixels. Display the equidistance pixel map. Demonstrate
   on a map with multiple obstacles.
