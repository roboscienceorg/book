#. What is the difference between *effect* and *affect*?

#. What is the difference between accuracy and precision?

#. Define domain and range.

#. Is the following constraint holonomic: :math:`\dot{x}_2\sin(x_1) + x_2 \cos(x_1)\dot{x}_1 = 1`.

#. Sketch the workspace of a two-link manipulator centered at the origin with :math:`a_1 = 15` and :math:`a_2 = 10`.

#. Assume that you have a two link planar manipulator. :math:`\theta_1` is
   the angle between the x axis (measured clockwise as positive) and the
   first link arm. :math:`\theta_2` is the angle between the second link
   arm and the first link arm (again measured clockwise as positive). Given
   the length of the first link :math:`a_1 = 12` and the second link
   :math:`a_2 = 7` solve the following:

   a. If :math:`\theta_1 = 45^\circ`, :math:`\theta_2 = 45^\circ`, find
      :math:`x` and :math:`y`.

   #. If :math:`\theta_1 = 45^\circ`, :math:`\theta_2 = 45^\circ`,
      :math:`d\theta_1/dt = 5^\circ s^{-1}`,
      :math:`d\theta_2/dt = 10^\circ s^{-1}` find :math:`dx/dt` and
      :math:`dy/dt`.

   #. If :math:`x = 12`, :math:`y = 14`, find :math:`\theta_1` and :math:`\theta_2`

#. Assume that you have a two link planar manipulator. :math:`\theta_1` is
   the angle between the x axis (measured clockwise as positive) and the
   first link arm. :math:`\theta_2` is the angle between the second link
   arm and the first link arm (again measured clockwise as positive). Due
   to servo limitations: :math:`-100^\circ < \theta_1 < 100^\circ`,
   :math:`-150^\circ < \theta_2 < 150^\circ`. Also assume the first link is
   20cm long and the second link is 15cm.

      Two link manipulator.

   a. Find the position of the end effector as a function of joint angles.

   #. Find the inverse kinematic formula.

#. Assume that you have a two link manipulator with :math:`a_1 = 15`\ cm
   and :math:`a_2 = 15`\ cm and that the base of the manipulator is at the
   origin of the coordinate system. Write a Python program to take the list
   of workspace points and plug them into the inverse kinematics formulas
   for the two link manipulator. Plot these points on a graph where
   :math:`\theta_1` is the horizontal axis and :math:`\theta_2` is the
   vertical axis. You will have to adjust some aspects to get a good
   looking plot. (Scale factors etc.) Test your code on the workspace line
   (a) :math:`x+y = 25`, :math:`x, y >0` and (b)
   :math:`x = 10\cos (t) + 15`, :math:`y = 10\sin (t)` for
   :math:`0 \leq t \leq \pi`. The point here is to see what the
   configuration space curve looks like.

#. Assume that you have a two link manipulator with :math:`a_1 = 15`\ cm
   and :math:`a_2 = 15`\ cm and that the base of the manipulator is at the
   origin of the coordinate system. Write a two link manipulator location
   program (Python). This program will take a list of angles and compute
   the location of the end effector. Show how this program works with the
   list of angles you generated in the previous problem. If the angle
   inputs are generated by a square, the simulated robot arm’s end effector
   should trace a square. Plot the end effector points. You need to plot
   the input shape and the final shape to see if your code is correct. You
   will need to use the previous problem for this problem. Demonstrate your
   code to trace out the four segments which form the square with endpoints
   (5,0), (5, 15), (20, 15), (20,0).

#. Typos can creep up in textbooks, papers and reference materials. How
   would test the accuracy of the formulas given in equations
   :eq:`paralleltwolinkforward` and :eq:`paralleltwolinkIK`? Discuss.

#. Find the forward velocity kinematics equations for the parallel two link manipulator.

#. Derive the formula for :eq:`paralleltwolinkforward`:

   .. math:: (x,y) = \left( \frac{a+c}{2} + \frac{v (b-d)}{u} , \frac{b+d}{2} + \frac{v (c-a)}{u} \right)

   Hint: define the segment from :math:`(a,b)` to :math:`(c,d)` as
   :math:`B` (the base of the triangle), and :math:`\vec{A}` as a vector
   which is a perpendicular to :math:`B`, see :numref:`Fig:paralleltwolink3` .

      Parallel Two Link Inverse Kinematics variables

#. Assume that you have a parallel two link manipulator with
   :math:`L_0 = 10`\ cm, :math:`L_1 = 15`\ cm and :math:`L_2 = 20`\ cm.
   Write a Python program to take the list of workspace points given and
   plug them into the inverse kinematics formulas for the two link
   manipulator. Plot these points on a graph where :math:`\theta_1` is the
   horizontal axis and :math:`\theta_2` is the vertical axis. As above, you
   will have to adjust some aspects to get a good looking plot. The point
   here is to see what the configuration space curve looks like. The
   workspace points are the list of points for the rectangle with corners
   (-5, 18), (5, 18), (5, 27), (-5,27). Use 10 points in each side of the
   rectangle.

#. Assume that you have a parallel two link manipulator with
   :math:`L_0 = 10`\ cm, :math:`L_1 = 15`\ cm and :math:`L_2 = 20`\ cm.
   Write a Python program that will take a list of angles and compute the
   location of the end effector. Show how this program works with the list
   of angles you generated in the previous problem. [If the angle inputs
   are generated by a rectangle, the simulated robot arm’s end effector
   should trace a rectangle.] Plot the end effector points. You will need
   to use the previous problem for this problem.

#. Using Numpy and the linspace command, build an array of
   points for :numref:`Fig:shapeforhw`. The top is
   given by :math:`(x-10)^2 + (y-8)^2 = 25` and the bottom is the line
   segment along :math:`y=8`. Traverse the figure starting at the right
   corner, going counter clockwise (circle first) and ending on the line
   segment. Check this with the Python plot command. Show the result.

      vector that is in-line (parallel) the the axle?

   #. What is the projection of :math:`<3,1>` onto the axle direction in
      the previous part?

   a total axle length (wheel to wheel) of 20 cms. If both wheels are
   turning at 0.8 revolutions per second, what is the speed of the robot.

#. Using the same robot as previous problem,  but
   where the left wheel is turning at 1.5 radians per second and the right
   wheel is turning at 1.8 radians per second. Determine the linear
   velocity and path of the robot. You may assume the initial pose is
   (0,0,0) at :math:`t=0`.

#. For the differential drive robot, let :math:`r=10`, :math:`L=15`,
   :math:`\dot{\phi_1} = 0.9` :math:`\dot{\phi_2}= 1.2`.

   a. What is the angular velocity of the robot?

   #. What is the velocity vector for the robot when
      :math:`\theta = 45^\circ`?

#. Let :math:`r=10`, :math:`L=15`. If you program the robot to drive
   straight and the robot traces out a circle of diameter 3 meters while
   traveling 1 m/s, what are the two wheel speeds?

#. Say you have a differential drive robot that has an axle length of 30cm
   and wheel diameter of 10cm. Find the angular velocity for the left and
   right wheel if the robot is going to
