Growing up in the modern age means many things to many people. For those
of us reading (or writing) a book on robotics, it means getting a
healthy dose of technology. Hollywood has raised us on spaceships,
cloning, alien worlds and intelligent machines. This was, however, not
incredibly unrealistic as progress in science and technology has been
advancing at an ever increasing rate. We have come to expect something
new, maybe even dramatic, every single year...and for the most part
haven’t been disappointed! Over the years we have seen significant
developments in medicine, space, electronics, communications and
materials. There has always been excitement regarding the latest
development. Even though the world around us has been struggling with
war, poverty and disease, science and technology offers us a reprieve.
It is an optimistic view that things can and will get better. In
full disclosure - we love technology! It is the magic of our age and
learning how the magic works only makes it more fun.

Robotics is a shining example of technical optimism - a belief that the
human condition can be improved through sufficiently advanced machines.
It is the premise that a machine can engage in the difficult, the
tedious, and the dangerous; leaving humans out of harms way. Technology
is a fancy word for tool utilization. Even though biologists have long
shown that humans were not alone in their usage of tools, we are
indisputably the master tool users on the planet. Tools extend our
grasp, our strength and our speed. We know of no technology that aims to
extend human capability like robotics does.

Robotics is an engineering discipline stemming from the fusion of
science and art. Humans have an insatiable curiosity, a drive to create,
and a considerable amount of self-interest. Building machines which look
like us, act like us and do things like us was the engineering manifest
destiny. Although we have succeeded in building machines that do
complicated tasks, we really place the value in what we learn about
ourselves in the process. A process we embark on here.
