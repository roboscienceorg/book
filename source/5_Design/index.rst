Robotics Design Elements
************************

Before we proceed with building robots, we need to address several aspects of
robot design which includes human aspects such as safety, human
interaction and human environments. Robots can be very helpful, capable
even lifesaving devices. However they can pose serious risks which need
to be recognized and addressed. In addition, there are complexities in
working with humans and in human environments which need to be addressed
as well. In this short chapter we examine some of the issues.
